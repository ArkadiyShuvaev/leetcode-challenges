## Prompt:
what is the two-pointer logic?

## Response:
Great question: **“what is the two-pointer logic?”** in the context of the `threeSum` problem.  
Let’s go step by step.

* * *

### 🔹 Idea Behind Two-Pointer Logic

When the array is **sorted**, instead of checking every possible pair (which is `O(n^2)` per `i`, leading to `O(n^3)`), we can **narrow the search space** with two pointers:

*   One pointer starts **from the left** (`left`).
*   Another pointer starts **from the right** (`right`).
*   We move them inward depending on whether the sum is too **small** or too **large**.

* * *

### 🔹 Why it works?

Because the array is sorted:

*   If `sum < 0`, we need a **larger number** → move `left++`.
*   If `sum > 0`, we need a **smaller number** → move `right--`.
*   If `sum === 0`, we found a triplet → move both pointers inward (and skip duplicates).

This eliminates unnecessary checks and guarantees `O(n^2)` complexity.

* * *

### 🔹 Step-by-Step Example

Input:

```js
nums = [-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]
```

1.  Fix `i = 0` → `nums[i] = -4`.  
    We need two numbers whose sum is `+4`.  
    Start `left = 1` (`-1`) and `right = 5` (`2`).
    *   Sum = `-4 + -1 + 2 = -3` → too small → move `left++`.
    *   Now `left = 2` (`-1`), `right = 5` (`2`).  
        Sum = `-3` → still too small → `left++`.
    *   `left = 3` (`0`), `right = 5` (`2`).  
        Sum = `-2` → too small → `left++`.
    *   `left = 4` (`1`), `right = 5` (`2`).  
        Sum = `-1` → too small → `left++`.
    *   Now `left >= right`, stop.
    → No triplet with `-4`.
2.  Fix `i = 1` → `nums[i] = -1`.  
    We need two numbers whose sum is `+1`.
    *   `left = 2` (`-1`), `right = 5` (`2`).  
        Sum = `0` → ✅ triplet found: `[-1, -1, 2]`.  
        Move `left++`, `right--`.
    *   `left = 3` (`0`), `right = 4` (`1`).  
        Sum = `0` → ✅ triplet found: `[-1, 0, 1]`.  
        Move `left++`, `right--`.
    → Done.
3.  Fix `i = 2` → `nums[i] = -1` (duplicate of previous).  
    Skip this `i` to avoid duplicate triplets.
4.  Fix `i = 3` → `nums[i] = 0`.  
    We need two numbers whose sum is `0`.
    *   `left = 4` (`1`), `right = 5` (`2`).  
        Sum = `3` → too big → move `right--`.
    *   Now `left >= right`, stop.
    → Done.

Final Answer:

```js
[[-1,-1,2], [-1,0,1]]
```

### 🔹 Visualization of Pointer Movement

Imagine the sorted array as a **line**:

```
[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]
   i   L                R
```

*   If sum too small → move **L → right**
*   If sum too big → move **R → left**
*   If sum correct → record triplet, then move both and skip duplicates.

* * *

### ✅ Summary

*   Two-pointer logic **uses sorted order** to eliminate brute force checks.
*   Instead of checking every pair, we adjust pointers **intelligently**.
*   Complexity: **O(n^2)** vs naive **O(n^3)**.

* * *

Would you like me to **draw this process step-by-step visually** (like diagrams for each pointer move), or just keep it in code + explanation?
