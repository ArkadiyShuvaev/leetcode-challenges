## üß† Practice Strategy

1. **Start** with fixed-size variations like #643, #239, and #438 to reinforce your conceptual grip.
2. Then **progress** to variable-size challenges like #209, #3, and #1004 ‚Äî they require two-pointer control and dynamic window resizing.
3. **Advanced problems** like #713, #904, and #1248 push you into sliding windows with auxiliary data structures and frequency tracking.
4. **Repeat and revisit** solved problems to internalize sliding window logic and transitions.

## üó£Ô∏è Community Voices

Reddit users emphasize:

> ‚Äúmost of the medium‚Äëish problems will involve the first two \[fixed or dynamic sliding windows]‚Ä¶ the harder problems will involve the latter \[dynamic with aux data structure].‚Äù ([medium.com][2], [reddit.com][1], [blog.algomaster.io][3], [reddit.com][4], [leetcode.com][5])

That matches our selection ‚Äî start with fixed or simple dynamic, then scale.
